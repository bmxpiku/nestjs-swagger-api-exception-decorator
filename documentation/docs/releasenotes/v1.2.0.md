### Breaking Changes

* New decorator signature: Single exceptions or multiple exceptions in an array now have to be passed with an arrow function.
  * Example: `@ApiException(() => BadRequestException)`
  * **The old signature without an arrow function is now deprecated and will be removed in future versions**
  * Using the old signature with the `@TemplatedApiException`-decorator will be detected and a warning including the class and method names will be printed to the console

### New Features

* Exceptions for multiple status codes may now be passed within a single decorator call
  * Example: `@ApiException(() => [BadRequestException, NotFoundException])`
  * No warnings are printed anymore and the grouping now works properly
* New option properties ([see new API description](/api))
  * `type`
  * `schema`
  * `isArray`

### Fixed Issues

* `null` as template value caused an error
